
Junior Pentester interview questions and answers

 

Question 1. Do You Filter Ports On The Firewall?

Answer :

You can filter ports on the firewall to block specific malware and protect the network from unnecessary traffic. For instance, some companies block port 21, the FTP port, when the company does not host or allow FTP communications.

Question 2. How Does Tracerout Or Tracert Work?

Answer :

traceroute and tracert work to determine the route that goes from the host computer to a remote machine. It’s used to identify if packets are redirected, take too long, or the number of hops used to send traffic to a host.

Question 3. What Are The Strengths And Differences Between Windows And Linux?

Answer :

Linux has some commands that Windows does not, but Windows is not open source and does not suffer from recent hacks such as Heartbleed.

Question 4. How Can You Encrypt Email Messages?

Answer :

You can use PGP to encrypt email messages or some other form of a public private key pair system where only the sender and the recipient can read the messages.

Question 5. What Kind Of Penetration Can Be Done With The Diffie Hellman Exchange?

Answer :

A hacker can use the man in the middle attack with the Diffie Hellman exchange since neither side of the exchange is authenticated. Users can use SSL or encryption between messages to add some kind of security and authentication.

Question 6. How Do You Add Security To A Website?

Answer :

The HTTP protocol allows for security behind authenticated pages and directories. If the user does not enter the right username and password, the server returns a 403 authentication HTTP error. This protects from unauthorized users.

Question 7. What Are Some Ways To Avoid Brute Force Hacks?

Answer :

You can stop authentication after a certain amount of attempts and lock the account. You can also block IP addresses that flood the network. You can use IP restrictions on the firewall or server.

Question 8. What Type Of Tools Are There Out There For Packet Sniffing?

Answer :

Wireshark is probably the most common packet sniffing tool. This program can help you find odd traffic across the network or identify a program that is sending traffic silently from a host.

Question 9. What Is The Difference Between Asymmetric And Symmetric Encryption?

Answer :

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for decryption and encryption. Asymmetric uses different keys.

Question 10. Why Should We Conduct A Penetration Test?

Answer :

IT is an integral part of every company's business today. Therefore, not only the amount of business-critical data that is stored on IT systems grows, but also the dependency on a working IT infrastructure. This leads to an increased amount of attacks against IT systems in the form of industrial espionage, denial of service attacks and other possibilities to significantly harm a company. Important corporate secrets are spied on and sold to competitors.

The availability of systems is interrupted, as a non-working IT is causing more and more problems today. No new orders are placed, because competitors somehow always have the better offer. A penetration test gives you information about your systems' vulnerabilities, how probable a successful attack against your infrastructure is and how you can protect yourself against potential security breaches in the future.

Question 11. Are There Legal Requirements For Penetration Tests?

Answer :

It may not be mandatory to do a penetration test for corporations, but the German law for example includes numerous text passages in its commercial laws which could be validated by conducting a penetration test.

Question 12. What Is The Workflow Of A Penetration Test?

Answer :

In advance of every penetration test, an individual meeting is held. In this meeting, the various possibilities of a penetration test in relation to the customer's systems are discussed. A penetration test only makes sense if it is realised in an individual and customer-oriented way.

Question 13. What Time Investment Do You Estimate For A Penetration Test?

Answer :

The time investment for a penetration test varies from case to case depending on the systems to be tested and the individual test requirements. Usually, the time needed ranges from a few days to several weeks. One goal of the preliminary meeting is to get enough information about the systems to be tested to estimate the optimal length for the penetration test.

Human resources on the customer's side are usually only marginally bound. Most notably, a contact person for questions during the exploitation phase is required.

Question 14. How Much Information Does Redteam Pentesting Need From Us?

Answer :

The type and amount of information needed varies with the kind of penetration test that is to be conducted. The two concepts mentioned most often are blackbox and whitebox tests. Unfortunately, those terms are not defined by a standard and can therefore mean different things, depending on who you talk to.

RedTeam Pentesting usually recommends a whitebox test. Penetration tests performed as complete blackbox tests always suffer from the fact that third parties might get involved without their explicit consent. Providing technical information in a whitebox test scenario before the test starts also allows the penetration testers to detect security vulnerabilities that are of importance to your company even faster and more efficiently.

It should always be acted on the assumption that real, serious attackers are able to obtain the necessary information prior to their attacks, or can procure it in time. A precise determination about what information is necessary to conduct an efficient test is done individually for every client during a preliminary meeting.

Question 15. What Are Blackbox And Whitebox Tests?

Answer :

A blackbox test is normally defined as a test where the penetration testers do not have any more information than attackers without internal knowledge might have. The idea is to check how deeply potential attackers can compromise your systems without any kind of internal information or access. All knowledge has to be gathered with classical reconnaissance (finding as much information as possible about the target) and enumeration (a deeper look at individual systems).

Despite the requirement of having as little information in the beginning as possible, at least a few specifications for the test have to be given, lest to unwillingly target uninvolved third parties. This does not pose a restriction for real attackers, but for every reputable company it should go without saying that all phases of a penetration test are only performed where explicit consent is given. This is not the case for third party systems, that would for example be affected by a portscan of a range of systems that presumably belong to the client the penetration test is conducted for.

In contrast, there is the whitebox test (sometimes also denoted as crystal-box test). In a whitebox test, the penetration testers already have internal knowledge about the target systems (for example network plans or a web application's source code) and possibly various access permissions. The latter could be an unprivileged user account to the company network, as it is available to employees, or login credentials for a web application like any normal customer would have.

This allows to test to what extent users with access to a system can misuse their permissions. Additionally, internal information may be provided that is also available to every staff member of company. This can be information about internal systems like web servers, mail servers, LDAP servers etc., but also for example organisational structures like employee's responsibilities and positions in the company. If only selected parts of information are divulged, this kind of test is also often called a graybox test.

Question 16. Why Should Not Only The Network Perimeter Be Tested, But Also The Internal Network?

Answer :

If your company's network is sufficiently hardened at the perimeter systems and it was not possible to successfully compromise it during a perimeter test, it still makes sense to additionally conduct an internal test. Just because the perimeter systems are sufficiently secured, it does not mean that the same precautions are taken on the internal network. Most of the time, too little security is done on the internal network, as it is supposedly only accessible by trustworthy persons. Especially in larger corporations though, not every employee needs the same access permissions.

The intern does not need to have the same access level as the CEO. It is therefore a severe problem if a security vulnerability appearing in the future that allows access to the internal network eliminates all safety precautions. If the financial incentive is big enough, it should also be no problem for attackers (competitors, business rivals) to either bribe one of your staff members or infiltrate your organization with somebody reporting back to them with all the data that is supposedly well guarded if seen from the outside.

Question 17. What Types Of Systems Does Redteam Pentesting Test?

Answer :

RedTeam Pentesting tests all kinds of systems. Frequently, the security vulnerabilities that matter the most are independent from the system's technology, making it possible to successfully test even previously unknown types of systems. Additionally, it goes with the job of being a penetration tester to have the ability to quickly adapt to new situations and systems.

Additionally, RedTeam Pentesting's service is not limited to the classic network- or web application penetration test. Newly developed hardware and other products are also tested, as well as security concepts only existing as a draft at the time of testing. In some particular cases, a penetration test conducted in response to the detection of a security incident can help in identifying the vulnerabilities exploited and in fixing them in a timely manner.

Question 18. Can Any Harm Be Done To Our Productive Systems During The Test?

Answer :

Unlike real attackers, RedTeam Pentesting pays great attention to a customer's production systems, so as to not interrupt them. We always go to the greatest extent to leave all systems unharmed in a penetration test. Attacks where the risk of a system failure is especially high are only performed with the client's explicit consent.

All in all, it is never possible to completely rule out that a production system crashes in a penetration test. To be able to get hold of someone as fast as possible in such a situation, emergency telephone numbers are exchanged prior to the test.

Question 19. Are Denial-of-service Attacks Also Tested?

Answer :

Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are usually only examined if it seems to be possible to put a system's availability at risk with very small effort. This can for example be a misconfiguration or a program error (say, if a system crashes when it gets sent an overly long request). Attacks like this will only be performed after an explicit agreement is provided, to verify if the attack is indeed possible.

On the other hand, attacks that try to saturate the bandwidth a company has at its disposal are usually not tested, as this is always possible for attackers with sufficient resources and will also affect third-party systems. Distributed denial-of-service attacks, that usually involve hundreds, if not thousands, of zombie systems (systems that were compromised and can now be remotely controlled) cannot be simulated realistically.

Question 20. Does Redteam Pentesting Do Social Engineering?

Answer :

Penetration tests may include social engineering techniques. These techniques are not without controversy though. More detailed information about the problems occuring with social engineering and penetration tests is available under exploitation. One safety measure against social engineering attacks can be trainings for your employees.

Question 21. What Happens To Confidential Data Redteam Pentesting Gathers During The Penetration Test?

Answer :

RedTeam Pentesting commits itself to absolute secrecy regarding your confidential data. A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) determining that RedTeam Pentesting treats a client's data as confidential is already part of every contract. All customer data, including information that is used to prepare a first quotation, is subject to the same obligation to confidentiality. At the end of a penetration test, all data and possible storage media is either securily destroyed or handed back to the client.

Question 22. Are The Results Written Down In A Report?

Answer :

Every client gets a detailed report at the end of a penetration test. A typical report includes a non-technical executive summary of the results, to give a short and precise overview of the current status, followed by a more extensive technical explanation for administrators, developers or other technical staff.

The individual problems enumerated in the report are separated into a detailed description, a risk analysis and proposed solutions, to directly give suggestions for improvement.

Question 23. What Other Products And Services Does Redteam Pentesting Offer?

Answer :

RedTeam Pentesting specialises in penetration tests and does not offer any other services. In particular, no products or services are sold after a penetration test, to guarantee independent and objective test results. The specialisation also ensures that RedTeam Pentesting's employees have a lot of experience and expert knowledge for conducting penetration tests.

Question 24. Can We Get A List Of Redteam Pentesting's References?

Answer :

Among RedTeam Pentesting's clients are national and international companies of all trades, including the following:

• Trade & industry

• Banking & insurance companies

• Public administration & authorities

• IT service providers & data centres

Because our customers set a high value on confidentiality, RedTeam Pentesting cannot publish a reference list. However, to get a first impression of our capabilities you can take a look at a selection of published testimonials, in which some of our customers report about their experience with RedTeam Pentesting.

Question 25. How Is Redteam Pentesting Different From Other Companies That Offer Penetration Tests?

Answer :

RedTeam Pentesting specialises exclusively in penetration tests, in contrast to many other companies in IT-security for which penetration tests are one of many business offerings. As the expertise for conducting a penetration test with specialized security experts is absent in many cases, quite often automated security scans are sold as penetration tests. Customers of such service providers most often receive a printout of the program's findings as the result of the »penetration test«.

RedTeam Pentesting in contrast employs security specialists who do close teamwork to achieve the best results. The results are documented in a detailed report by the penetration testers that performed the test, with the ambition to communicate the necessary knowledge about the vulnerabilities in an understandable way. For our customers, this means that vulnerabilities can be better comprehended and issues solved more efficiently. RedTeam Pentesting particularly does not sell any other services before or after a penetration test. The penetration test should not serve to sell extra services, but should be an independent security examination.

Additionally, all of RedTeam Pentesting's employees are permanent employees and publicly listed on our website. Even during workload peaks, no subcontractors or freelancers are hired, to guarantee the high quality of the tests as well as strict confidentiality.

Question 26. In What Countries Does Redteam Pentesting Offer Penetration Tests?

Answer :

RedTeam Pentesting works for many international customers. The project language for penetration tests is either English or German. Depending on specific customer demands, penetration tests can be performed locally at the client's premises, or via the Internet or other means of remote access. It is of course also possible to conduct a penetration test on a client's test system in RedTeam Pentesting's laboratory, for example in case of a product pentest.

Question 27. What Is Network Penetration Testing?

Answer :

A penetration test, also referred to as “pentest”, is a method of evaluating the security of a computer system or network by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders (without any authorised means of accessing the company's networks) but also malicious insiders (who have some level of authorised access).

The process involves an active analysis of the system for any potential vulnerabilities that could result from poor or improper system configuration, known and unknown hardware or software flaws, or operational weaknesses.

The analysis is carried out from the position of a potential hacker and can involve active exploitation of security vulnerabilities.

Question 28. Is Network Penetration Testing The Same As Network Vulnerability Assessment?

Answer :

There are many names for this type of security service. Network vulnerability assessment, network audit, network vulnerability scan, network penetration testing, they may all mean the same thing. BorderSecure is the name of Omniquads Network penetration service.

Question 29. Why Is It Critical To Have An On-going Assessment Of Your Networks’ Security?

Answer :

As new security issues and flaws with different products are made public on a daily basis, it is important to carry out regular checks in order to maintain a secure network. We check for holes in your Internet infrastructure, and the ideal way to stay secure on the Internet is to stay ahead of hackers, at all times.

Question 30. Why Should A Third Party Assess Your System?

Answer :

If you have your own IT department implement your security system, it is to your advantage to let an impartial third party do the audit. We provide an outsiders view on how easy/difficult it is to compromise your integrity. Having an audit report from a third party outlining all confirmed security vulnerabilities on the network provides invaluable information to any network administrator.

The service is fast, and you will have the advantage of continually knowing how secure your network is and what you can do to improve it.

Question 31. What Is Omniquad Bordersecure?

Answer :

Omniquad BorderSecure is a service that performs network audits or network penetration testing — it identifies security vulnerabilities and weaknesses on networks. The information can be used to assess security, manage risks, and eliminate security vulnerabilities before third parties can take advantage of potential security holes on your network. Omniquad BorderSecure is a service that can tell you how hackers can gain access to your networks, and help you prevent such a security breach.

Question 32. We Have A Firewall In Place. Do We Still Need Network Penetration Testing If We Have A Firewall?

Answer :

The simple answer is yes. Network penetration testing is especially important if you have a Firewall, as it forms a part of your assessment of your Firewalls efficiency. Performing a network scan or penetration test when you have a firewall will test the settings on your Firewall. It is important to test your Firewall each time you have made upgrades or changes to the settings, to ensure it is protecting your network the way it should.

Question 33. Will Firewalls Interfere With Omniquad Bordersecure?

Answer :

Firewalls are an essential part of network security. Omniquad BorderSecure assesses firewall's effectiveness in addition to applications and protocols such as web, FTP, and e-mail that are frequently accessible through firewalls. The system also looks for holes in the firewall; it is often the case that misconfigured firewalls pose security threats.

Question 34. Can I Target Any Ip Address?

Answer :

Yes we can check any and as many IP addresses as you want provided they belong to you. We will not check any third party IP address.

Question 35. Is Network Penetration Testing Safe?

Answer :

Yes it is completely safe, skilled Omniquad engineers are probing your network from outside your organisation. However, if there should be any glitches, it is better that it happens under a controlled sweep of your network since this in itself is exposing network vulnerabilities, some of which could indicate that your business would be defenceless to Denial of Service attacks.

Question 36. Is The Service Host-based Or Network-based?

Answer :

Omniquad BorderSecure is host-based (on a dedicated server) outside your network. The service checks your network via the Internet — much like a hacker would try to break into your company from the outside. This gives you a realistic analysis of your network vulnerabilities.

Question 37. How Many Different Types Of Vulnerabilities Can Omniquad Bordersecure Detect?

Answer :

Omniquad BorderSecure runs scans and audits on all types of networks. Our team tests new vulnerabilities for ensuring that our knowledge database remains comprehensive at all times, and currently we check for up to 1000 different vulnerabilities.

Question 38. What Happens After Omniquad Bordersecure Detects Vulnerabilities On My Network?

Answer :

Omniquad BorderSecure provides a detailed report outlining each vulnerability, including: The vulnerable host(s), Operating system weaknesses, Level of security risk of the vulnerability, Description of the vulnerability, Recommendation for correcting the problem.

Question 39. Does Bordersecure Fix Vulnerabilities Found Automatically?

Answer :

No, we point out the weaknesses and recommend solutions. It is not advisable to perform automatic fixes, even if it was possible, since this could cause a variety of concerns. BorderSecure informs you about security risks, it is your responsibility to follow up the recommendations to secure your network perimeter. However, we can offer advice should this be necessary.
